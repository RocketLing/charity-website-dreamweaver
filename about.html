			<h2 class="font-weight-light text-secondary mt-3">History & Mission</h2>
			<p>In the wake of a fire or disaster, people are injured, homes and families are destroyed and lives change forever. 
			The Fire Hero Foundation, a non-profit organization, provides emotional and financial assistance to families
			 of fallen firefighters, firefighters and the communities they protect. </p>
		
			<p>Formed in 2013 by California Professional Firefighters, our Foundation includes an array of survivor 
				and victim assistance projects and community initiatives which provide direct aid to victims of fire 
				or disaster, other non-profit agencies, and volunteer fire departments. 
				Our primary focus is to provide much needed financial assistance to individuals who have been affected 
				by a fire or disaster, to support other disaster or prevention related charities and institutions, and
				volunteer fire departments. We also have a nationwide volunteer brigade that acts as our eyes and ears 
				to identify those in critical need.</p>
			
			<p>Firefighters Helping Firefighters was born out of the tragic Southwest Inn Fire in 2013 and since then
				we have provided over $500,000 to 300 fire families in crisis. There is no other organization
				in California that serves active duty firefighters and yet there is a significant and growing need.</p>
			<p>We have many firefighter families suffering from life threatening illnesses requiring extended medical
				care, many have had major surgeries, some have suffered loss of their dependents and some families
				have lost their firefighter in the line of duty. We are THEIR safety net.</p>
			<p>In addition to these services for firefighters, we also give back to the community through
				our Hanginâ€™ With Heroes program where our firefighters spend quality time with hospitalized 
				children playing games, doing art, telling stories and having fun. This program is soon expanding 
				to adult physical and mental rehabilitation hospitals and clinics.</p>


			<h4 class="text-danger mt-5">The Day that Changed Everything</h4>

			<p>May 31st 2013 was the most devastating and deadly fire in the Fire Department history, 
				where a 5-alarm motel fire claimed the lives of Now FIVE Firefighters and injured 
				many others. This horrific event was the catalyst for several California Firefighters who wanted
				to create an organization dedicated to helping other firefighters in need.</p>
			<p>Fire Heroes (Firefighters Helping Firefighters) has been able to help 300 firefighters/families since our inception May of 2013. 
				We provide financial assistance to critically injured or sick firefighters and their 
				families who are burdened with extensive hospital or treatment medical expenses and funeral costs.</p>
